                        <li>That said, <b>all comments are moderated</b>.</li>
                        <li>Comments are <b><i>not</i></b> moderated based on viewpoint. They are moderated solely for civility.</li>
                        <li>The Mad Propster is only one person, so please be patient waiting for your comment to appear on the site.</li>
